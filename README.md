# CS-220-Scripts-Project-
The plan is to make a software using the scripting language Autohotkey(https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm) which allows the user to make custom hotkeys on their keyboard to launch certain apps.
I plant to make a gui implementation of the language where the user will only have to select the keys and the app they want to open and 
not see any of the scripting stuff.
This might be too ambitious but i want to add hotkeys for app controls too such as volume control, spotify next/volume, youtube next/volume,
opening a certain website and so on.
I will do the scripting using auto hotkey and implement the gui using java/python or something along those lines.





The Spotify.ahk is a premade script i found on github :https://gist.github.com/jcsteh/7ccbc6f7b1b7eb85c1c14ac5e0d65195.
I only added the command to open spotify.
P.S note that the script only works if you run spotify before running the script.
Quick note: might need to spam win+alt+o to open the window and hide it. After hiding it make sure to click anywhere else before using the hotkeys.

The TextlanguagetoNormal.txt file contains scripts to change text words such as "idk" into "I don't know" and "sry" to "Sorry". You can load it into yourHotKey.ahk file using the loadtextscript method.
